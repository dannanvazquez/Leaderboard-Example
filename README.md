# Leaderboard-Example
I'm releasing this Rock Paper Scissors game as a tech demonstration of online leaderboards. I spent about three days obtaining a good understanding of how to get a working online leaderboard using player accounts. These player accounts are created by signing up using a username and password that meet the requirements and then allowing a name change or account deletion as an option. I intended to make the gameplay very simple as it wasn't my main focus. I just created this example to show that the online leaderboard was functional. The plan is to use this project as a template for other games that will definitely need an online leaderboard.
